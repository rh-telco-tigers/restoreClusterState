Let's do a backup from the leader server since this will be the one that will be used to do restore.

oc debug node/<leadernodethatetcdisrunningon> (listed in step 1)
chroot /host

/usr/local/bin/cluster-backup.sh /home/core/assets/backup/ (ensure there are no other backups in this directory prior to running)


To test restore state, we will create a project called "thisprojectwilldissapear"

oc new-project thisprojectwilldissapear

The restore won't have this project
